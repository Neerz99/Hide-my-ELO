# Hide my ELO

A simple browser extension that hides most occurences of your and other players rating on **Chess.com**.

WIP :

- On/Off button to activate/deactivate extension
- Hide rating on other pages

Currently working and tested for :

- Main page
- Bullet
- Blitz
- Rapid

⚠️ Ratings are still visible under the profile/stats page and there might be rating leaking in variants game mode, or other pages.
